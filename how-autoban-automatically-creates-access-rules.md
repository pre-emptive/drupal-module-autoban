# How Autoban Automatically Creates Access Rules

Autoban can create Access rules automatically based on a number of factors:

* A visitor exceeds a given number of requests per unit time (e.g. 30 requests in 15 minutes)
* A visitor fails to answer, or incorrectly answers a Challenge a number of times
* A visitor is banned more than a certain number of times in a time period (e.g. 5 offences in 1 day)
* A visitor submits more than a certain number of Spam content (feature requires Mollom integration)
* More than a certain number of IP addresses in a subnet have been banned
